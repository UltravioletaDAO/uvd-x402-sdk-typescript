/**
 * Live traffic stream client (`GET /events`, Server-Sent Events).
 *
 * The facilitator emits one event per operation it handles, so you can render or
 * react to live traffic without polling and without scraping logs.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { streamTrafficEvents } from '@ultravioletadao/x402-sdk';
 *
 * for await (const event of streamTrafficEvents()) {
 *   console.log(event.kind, event.network, event.ok, event.tx);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Only settlements on the chains you care about. The facilitator has NO
 * server-side filter by network, so this is applied client-side.
 * ```ts
 * const stream = streamTrafficEvents({
 *   networks: ['base', 'polygon'],
 *   kinds: ['settle'],
 * });
 * for await (const event of stream) console.log(event.tx);
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties of this stream decide how you should use it:
 *
 * **It is lossy by design.** The facilitator will never slow down or fail a
 * payment to keep an observer in sync, so an event you were not connected for is
 * simply gone. Treat it as a live hint and use the chain as the source of truth.
 * Absence of events is NOT evidence that nothing happened.
 *
 * **Failed operations are not published.** Only operations that resolved emit an
 * event, so `ok: false` means "resolved and came back negative", never "blew up".
 * A stream that looks healthy is not proof that the rail is.
 *
 * **Admission is bounded.** The endpoint is public and unauthenticated, so it
 * sheds with HTTP 503 + `Retry-After` once too many subscribers are connected,
 * and returns 404 when the operator disabled it.
